Problem Identification:
In the face of economic volatility and changing donor behaviours charities are facing the 
problem of evaluating and improving the efficiency of their fundraising campaigns. Due to the 
global recession, regular benefactors are facing an economic breakdown due to which charities 
are facing a decline in donations and grants hence people dependent on them are affected 
adversely (Preston, 2024). With the evolve of modern methodologies, conventional methods 
may not be enough so it's important to methodically identify the factors that influence 
successful fundraising, properly customise donor communications, and make sure that 
resources are used as efficiently as possible. The core problem we focus on is how to apply 
machine learning and other modern-day technologies to better comprehend and enhance the 
effectiveness of fundraising campaigns and automate the process.
